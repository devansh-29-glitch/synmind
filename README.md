### ðŸš€ About
**SynMind** simulates the partnership between emotion and reason.  
Each agent adapts through interaction â€” mirroring **System 1 & System 2 cognition** (Daniel Kahnemanâ€™s theory).  
This project demonstrates adaptive neural coupling without any pre-training data â€” only mutual learning.

**Core components:**
- `agent_emotional/` â€“ affect-based predictions  
- `agent_rational/` â€“ logic-based decisions  
- `symbiosis_trainer/` â€“ merges gradients + mutual feedback  
- `dashboard/` â€“ live visualization (trust, reward, harmony)
